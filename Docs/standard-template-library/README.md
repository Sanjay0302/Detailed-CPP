# Standard Template Library

1. STL is a Software library designed by <mark style="color:green;">Alexander Stepanoy</mark> for C++ Programminf language.
2. It Provides 4 components:
   1. Algorithms
   2. Containers
   3. Functions
   4. Iterators
   5. Allocators
3. STL is set of Common Classes for C++, such as containes and associative arrays, that can be used with any built-in type and with any user-defined type.
4. STL achives its results through the use of templates. This approach provides compile-time polymorphism that is often more efficient than run-time polymorphism.

### The main components of STL Library

1. [**Containers**](containers/) **:** in C++ STL are used to store and manage collections of objects, offering various ways to organize and access data with built-in manipulation functionalities. They are categorized into four types:&#x20;
   1. **Sequence Containers** (e.g., `vector`, `list`, `deque`) that store elements in sequential order;&#x20;
   2. **Associative Containers** (e.g., `set`, `map`, `multiset`, `multimap`) that allow fast retrieval based on keys;&#x20;
   3. **Unordered Associative Containers** (e.g., `unordered_set`, `unordered_map`) that provide average constant time complexity for lookups;&#x20;
   4. **Container Adaptors** (e.g., `stack`, `queue`, `priority_queue`) that offer specific interfaces to other containers.
2. [**Algorithms**](algorithms.md) : The STL includes a wide range of algorithms that can be applied to the containers. These algorithms include operations for searching, sorting, modifying, and manipulating data. Examples include `sort`, `find`, `copy`, and `accumulate`
3. [**Iterators**](iterators.md) **:** Iterators are objects that provide a way to access the elements of a container sequentially without exposing the underlying representation. They act as a bridge between containers and algorithms, allowing algorithms to work with any container that supports iterators.
4. [**Function Objects or Functors**](function-object-or-functors.md) : These are objects that can be called as if they were functions. They are often used to customize the behavior of algorithms.
5. [**Allocators**](allocators.md) **:** The STL provides a mechanism for memory management through allocators, which define how memory is allocated and deallocated for containers.
