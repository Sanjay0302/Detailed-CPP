# Welcome

"A Handbook for Programmers" by [Sanjay Byrannanavar](https://app.gitbook.com/u/kPqxmQQQfueaoJiDax0STpmCQCf2) covers various topics in C++ programming, offering brief overviews and explanations of implementation. However, this can still be challenging for beginners to fully grasp the concepts. I have prepared this GitBook content with the assumption that readers have some prior exposure to atleast basic topics of C++ Programming. It includes a collection of codes designed for learners from beginner to advanced levels, covering both basic and advanced C++ concepts.

## RoadMap

* If you have any requests for implementing a specific section of the handbook earlier or have concerns about the current codes, please raise those issues.
* Further, I will add more codes as time :clock1: allows.

Curently the I'm using Basic Version of Gitbook which wont allow me to collaborate in Gitbook, So the other way is to follow the below method;

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b newsection`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m ' Added section/code : "Description" '` )
4. Push the branch ( `git push origin newsection`)
5. Open a Pull request.
